## Godot Frame Normalizer

This little tool allows you to normalize a sprite sheet for the size of the frames, for Godot.

With Godot 4.X it is no longer possible to manually put a margin, and it's annoying to do all that with photoshop :)

### Todo
- Make a distance between the original image and the final image
- Add an "Export" button to export the final image
- Improve the margin for the final image, the algorithm does not manage well
- Improve the sprite detection, the first sprite is on the far right and shift the finale image to the right quite well
